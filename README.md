There is additional 8 LED's in three different colors which can be changed from the code as well. In this code, it has a combination of 3 red, 2 green and 2 blue led. The motor driver is the adafruit driver version 2. The code is configured for 4 wheels but if you are using 2 wheeled robot then use channel 1 and 3. Pin 2 is the data pin for the LED and the ultrasonic sensor is at A0 and A1.
